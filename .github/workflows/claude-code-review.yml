          direct_prompt: |
            Code review: Be concise and direct. If code is good, just say "LGTM" (looks good to me).

            Only comment on:
            - Bugs or logic errors
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Major performance issues
            - Code that breaks established patterns in this codebase
            - Ignore the atlantis plan output when checking the PR as this will be asked on demand

            Format: One-line comments only. No explanations unless critical.
            Skip: Style nitpicks, minor optimizations, alternative approaches.
            Be CONCISE!

          # use_sticky_comment: true
